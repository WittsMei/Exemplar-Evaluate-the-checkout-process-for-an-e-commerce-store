Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed checkout evaluation. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Note: The exemplar identifies some of the potential issues and suggestions for the checkout process. However, your answers will likely differ in certain ways. What’s important is that you were able to identify common issues and provide suggestions to resolve those issues.

Let’s review each checkout issue:

Checkout issue #1: Sign-in
Identify the issue: The current checkout process does not give customers the option to check out as a guest, which is one of the main reasons why customers abandon their carts.

Suggest improvements: The best way to resolve this issue is to add guest checkout. Allowing customers to sign in using a social account is another option that could make the sign-in process easier.

Checkout issue #2: Personal information
Identify the issue: The current checkout process is too long, which is one of the main reasons why customers abandon their carts.

Suggest improvements: Including only the necessary fields makes the checkout process shorter and easier. In this case, removing the additional phone number fields and birthdate would make the checkout process faster.

Checkout issue #3: Shipping
Identify the issue: The current checkout process requires the customer to pay for shipping, which is one of the main reasons why customers abandon their carts.

Suggest improvements: Offering free shipping options will reduce the chances of a customer leaving the site and buying from a competitor instead.

Checkout issue #4: Payment
Identify the issue: The current checkout process only allows the customer to pay with a credit card, which is one of the main reasons why customers abandon their carts.

Suggest improvements: Adding more payment options and assuring customers that the store’s website is secure can increase the chances that a customer will complete their purchase.
